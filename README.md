# Music_Retrieval_Systems

Learnt about the basic architecture of query by humming system, note segmentation and quantization.
Worked with hidden markov models (HMM) for automatic chord detection and learnt other probabilistic
models structure segmentation

Understood the basics of audio watermarking and fingerprinting, landmark extraction, quantization,
jaccard similarity, minhash and locality sensitive hashing

Worked with self similarity matrices and dynamic programming for polyphonic audio score alignment

Implemented sound source separation using Non-negative matrix factorization and compared the results
with state of the art sound source separation library spleeter by Deezer. Got conversant with
temporal and frequency masking. 

Gained experience with music21(symbolic representation), librosa(audio processing), numpy, scipy,
pandas and scikit-learn.
